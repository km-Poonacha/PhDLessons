    "1. A CSV file is often used exchange format for spreadsheets and databases.\n",
    "2. Each line is called a record and each field within a record is seperated by a delimiter such as comma, tab etc.\n",
    "3. Keep in mind that Mac uses a different delimiter to determine the end of a row in a CSV file ('\\r') than Microsoft ('\\r\\n'). Since the CSV python module we will use works well with Windows CSV files, we will save and use a Windows CSV file in our program. So in MAC, you have to save the CSV file as \"windows csv\" file rather than just csv file.\n",
