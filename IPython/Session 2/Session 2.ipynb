The way these work is similar to viewing a web page. When you point your browser to a website, you do it with a URL (http://www.yelp.com for instance). Yelp sends you back data containing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Your browser uses this data to construct the page that you see. The API works similarly, you request data with a URL (http://api.yelp.com/stuff), but instead of getting HTML and such, you get data formatted as JSON."
